# BMI Calculator🩻

An application written during the development course. While writing this project, we delved deeper into OOP 
principles, custom widgets, and explored new widgets such as the slider or Material button.

## Technologies🔧

#### - Flutter
#### - OOP
#### - Custom Widgets
#### - Flutter Material Widgets

## Interface💻

The application interface is a screen with cards inside which the user enters his parameters. 
At the bottom of the screen there is a calculation button, after clicking on it, a new screen 
appears with the calculated body mass index of the user and a comment in accordance with his indicators.

### Functionality🕹

On the main screen there are two gender cards, which are united by functions and work on 
the principle of a switch.

The next component is a card with a built-in slider. Using it, the user indicates his height.

Next on the screen there are two cards - Age and Weight. Each of them contains a “+” and “-” buttons 
to change the parameters in one direction or another.

At the bottom there is a count button that takes the user to the next screen. The application contains a 
function with a formula for calculating body mass index taken from open sources. After clicking on the 
calculation button, the application calculates BMI using this formula using user parameters and displays 
the resulting coefficient on a new screen.

In addition to BMI, there are comments on the screen that describe the values of this parameter. 
The range of body weight norm parameters was also taken from open sources.

Also on the new screen there is a restart button, which allows you to enter data again.

As a result, we get an example of a simple application for calculating the body mass index of users⚖️
